## mesh data

It is decentralized data architecture which contains products and product owners where every product they produce are managed by the product manager.
It has also capabilities like transferring the data access for business purpose by data product owners.
This architecture consists of main four principles: 
•	Domain-driven design- This will encourage the organization to collect, manage data by dividing into domains for further growth. Each domain has its own authority on the data they have collected and processed.
•	Data as a product – this principal ensures that the utilization of the data is done in a secured and understandable manner. This also involves maintaining the quality of the data this data is distributed around the multiple domines.
•	Self-serve data infrastructure as a service – this allows access only if the domine is only capable with required resource. Security and privacy policies are not customizable for individual domines where the these are configured in decentralized data.
•	Governance- when it comes to decentralized data we need consistency and reliability to run operations which are useful to run activities. This involves effective governance tactics like decision making, global policies.
Data mesh architecture:
 
This architecture will allow every domain in the has access of the data across the organization and each domine is responsible for there data maintenance of operational and analytical data management. 
Through publish data products the data can be accessed over the domains. Each domain acts as an individual where they build there own data products and run analysis. 
The domain team will agree with certain policies and governance standards to use the products created by the domines.
